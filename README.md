# Tribool

Tribool is a Swift micro-library that provides an Obj-C-compatible `Tribool` enum type, for representing 3-value logic states: `.true`, `.false`, and `.indeterminate`.

The master branch is Swift 5.x, and build overlays (the minimal changeset to the Package.swift, xcodeproj, and other build files) of the current library version are available on the [swift-4.2](https://github.com/capnslipp/Tribool/tree/swift-4.2), [swift-4](https://github.com/capnslipp/Tribool/tree/swift-4), and [swift-3](https://github.com/capnslipp/Tribool/tree/swift-3) branches.  _(Note: I don't check that these are built as often as I used to when Swift 4.2 or 4.0 were the latest versions, but their changes haved worked and I've merged new library versions into them since then.)_
